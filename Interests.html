        <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
        <p>In my professional life my interests are weighted towards marketing, but I've always enjoyed writing code.  My happiest days at work were when I could throw some headphones on and spend all day developing a new email template or landing page for a campaign.</p>
        <p>Completing the FEWD Techdegree will hopefully provide more opportunities for coding and development days in my next job.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, i also enjoy the following at work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Omni-channel digital marketing campaign development</li>
          <li>Marketing and Sales Strategy</li>
          <li>Content and copy creation</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>My main interests outside of work are my puppy and the outdoors.</p>
        <h3>Penny the Puppy</h3>
        <p>Penny is a 7 month old German Shepherd.  <em>(Her picture is all over the site so I won't add another one here.)</em>  She is my second German Shepherd.  This summer I'm working on basic training with her:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sit and Stay commands</li>
          <li>Jumping and biting</li>
          <li>Leash manners</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Outdoors</h3>
        <p>I love doing many outdoor activities.  My main love is backpacking.  My last backpacking trip was hiking a portion of the Camino de Santiago in Spain.  Prior to that, I've spent many backcountry nights in Yosemite and Glacier National Parks.</p>
