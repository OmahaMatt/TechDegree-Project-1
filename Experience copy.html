        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm a marketing professional looking for a new adventure in Front-end web development.  After 11 years at a large tech company the idea of learning some new skills, and improving some existing ones, sounded extremely exciting.  So...I left my job, took my puppy for some introspective walks, and now here I am, learning HTML and CSS at Team Treehouse.</p>
        <p>Speaking of my puppy, her name is Penny and she's a 7 month old German Shepherd.  She keeps me extremely busy.  When i'm not entertaining her, you'll find me outside.  Hiking, biking, kayaking, campaign...I love it all.  I also enjoy traveling, most recently making a trip to Spain and Portugal to celebrate my momn's 60th birthday.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I have some experience with HTML and CSS from my previous job, but my skills are rusty.  With the Techdegree I want to learn new things, re-learn some forgotten things, and build out a well-rounded web development skillset, including:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After i'm done with the Techdegree program, my plan is to take my new skills with me on my next adventure, wherever that may be.</p>
